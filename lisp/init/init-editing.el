   ;; Use single space after sentences.
   ;;
   ;; It's standard typographic practice. Double spacing is acceptable
   ;; in monospaced fonts, though even there single spacing is more
   ;; common nowadays. Using double spacing only when using monospaced
   ;; fonts is also inconvenient: you'd use double spacing in code
   ;; comments, plain-text email, etc. but would have to switch to
   ;; single spacing everywhere else where proportional fonts are
   ;; used, thus making it harder to develop muscle memory.
   ;;
   ;; Another argument is that double spacing unambiguously determines
   ;; the end of sentence (so sentence-selection commands work
   ;; correctly), but that is not so. Consider:
   ;;
   ;;   Bob said, "I get three apples.  You get two apples.  Ok?"
   ;;
   ;; The first sentence is not `Bob said, "I get three apples.',
   ;; though that's what Emacs would detect. If the goal is to
   ;; accurately determine the end of sentences, we must use more
   ;; sophisticated heuristics; a naÃ¯ve search for `. ' won't do.

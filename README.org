My Emacs config. A lot of inspiration taken from:

- [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Steve Purcell's emacs.d]]
- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]
- and others

** Dependencies

The following are dependency programs. Some parts of the config may
not work if they are not installed:
